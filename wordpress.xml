  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Well, I know what I <i>should</i> do... I should by studying. Hard. Almost excessively. I still got 9 days left until the exam on database systems. I need to take this exam and I know it. There's no other way. But I have always preferred the art of procrastination over everything else, so guess what I'm doing? Yepp... procrastinating...
Right now, I'm knitting my ass off for Mom's Seascape Stole. I started the 6th pattern repeat today and I plan on having it finished by the end of the day. I'm nuts.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[So it took me 2 days to finish the 6th pattern repeat on Mum's Seascape Stole. Even though I didn't study much today, somehow this day was totally wasted. I'll have to make up for the time I lost today so I'm planning on spending tomorrow entirely in my university's library, far away from knitting, household tasks or my yarn stash (which I tried to organize today but gave up after photographing some skeins for my Ravelry stash...). Maybe I'll finish going through the slides tomorrow - it would be progress that justifies an evening spent with knitting. Or I'll go out and have a beer with some friends.
'Finish the slides first', says the mean voice in my head. Yes, sir!!]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Stricksucht</strong>, <em>f.</em> German term for knitting addiction

Just in case that you have been wondering why my English sounds so strange sometimes... I'm German, so I'm not what you would call a native speaker. But I'm trying, though. Please be so kind to let me know when I make major mistakes - I love to learn ;)

<strong>So what is this about?</strong>
I want this blog to be about knitting, about my current projects and their process, about techniques I learned here and there (mostly on the internet), about my ideas for knitwear, and so on.

<strong>So what am I about?</strong>
My mother taught me the basics of knitting (how to cast on, knit, purl, and bind off) when I was 9 or 10 years old, but I was more interested in crocheting back then. At the age of 15, however, I became interested in knitting, and after my mother gave me her box of leftover yarns and a book covering the basics of handcrafting, I was ready for my very first scarf. It was just a plain, light blue scarf in simple 1x1 rib, but I'm still wearing it every year from fall to the first signs of spring.

My knitting addiction didn't become serious until 2 or 3 years ago, when I discovered the fabulous knitty.com. I learned the English names for stitches and - more importantly - I learned that knitting is more than the slightly boring and non-challenging patterns I knew from German knitting magazines. And since then, I spend my spare time knitting, beginning even more knitting projects or convincing my friends to join me in my knitting frenzy.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I tried. I really did. But after reraveling this gorgeous yarn from Mommy's stash I just HAD to see how it would work out in a pattern. Sarah Castor's <a href="http://knitty.com/ISSUEspring08/PATThoneycomb.html" target="_top">Honeycomb vest</a> seemed like the perfect fit for the yarn's color and quality, and because I wanted (really, really badly) to knit it since I first laid my eyes on it I couldn't resist. And well, here's the result:

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[In the <a href="http://www.knitty.com/ISSUEsummer08/PATTseascape.html" target="_blank">original Seascape pattern</a> there's a note that some people felt the stole would be better-sized when adding a 7th repeat of the main pattern. I'm already in the midst of the 7th repeat but I still feel that the stole might come out waaaaaaay too short, so I'm thinking about adding another repeat of the pattern. Well, yeah, I don't even know if the 3 skeins of KSH will suffice for 8 pattern repeats, so IF they do then there won't be any leftovers for me. But on the other hand, I'm knitting this stole for Mum who bought the yarn. Let's just hope that I can make it 8 pattern repeats and the finishing - I can always consider other options if it won't work out.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>"I've got another confession to make..."</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Yeah, well, I didn't do it. I didn't finish Mom's Seascape Stole. Partly because I actually spent the last couple of days learning (10 hours in the library, followed by whatever I could bring myself to back at home), and partly because my RSI kicked in again. So Seascape will have to wait until my wrist gets better *sigh*
But I've got another project coming up: After reading <a href="http://knitty.com/ISSUEwinter07/FEATwin07FK.html" target="_top">this knitty article</a> and <a href="http://eunnyjang.com/knit/2006/01/steeking_chronicles_the_should.html" target="_top">Eunny Jang's Steeking Chronicles</a> (especially <a href="http://www.eunnyjang.com/knit/2006/01/the_steeking_chronicles_part_i.html" target="_top">the part on the crocheted steek</a>), I remembered a very old sweater of mine I bought at a H&amp;M store about 8 years ago. It never fitted me very well so I can't even remember wearing it. It's got kind of a turtleneck and raglan sleeves, so any large-busted woman in her right mind would have kept her hands off such a sweater. So here's my thought: Why not find out if the thing looks better when worn as a cardigan? It can't be worse than it is now, right? So once I'll get back to Ulm I think I'll instantly take this thing out of my closet, cut it apart in the middle and sew in a zipper. And of course, I'll document the process ;)]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[You all know these New Year's resolutions, right? These "Next year, I'll stop smoking/ work out more/ study harder/ insert unrealistic possibility for change of behavior here". Well, even though my best friend and I termed these resolutions as "Ideas for potential changes of behavior" because we thought with a name like this, our resolutions might actually work out for us - they don't ;) I still refrain from kicking guys that screw with me and I still don't eat healthier. At least I've never been a smoker so that's something I can't fail at stopping or changing. To put it in a nutshell: My #1 golden resolution was: "Never work at more than one project at a time!" Yeah well, worked out great for me...
Firstly, I only set the status for 11 of my 17 unfinished Ravelry projects to "hibernating" because I couldn't stand the look of my notebook with all these less-than-20%-wips.
Secondly, not all my projects are in Ravelry.
Thirdly, even that doesn't stop me from constantly starting new projects because I liked the pattern, or the yarn, or just wanted to keep my hands busy. Truth is, I bore really easily...

So, what's the status? Mom's Seascape Stole is at something like 80% and if I only could bring myself to pick up the needles, count my sorry self through the last (!!!) repeat of the main pattern, find out if 3 balls of KSH are enough for 8 repeats of the main pattern and finish that thing, I could merrily be knitting my first version of Honeycomb soon. (I started, as you know, because I simply couldn't resist the yarn, but if I go and pick up my knitting it's usually Mom's Seascape Stole.)
But, alas!, I wouldn't be me, if I didn't go ahead and start something stupid.Thanks to Ravelry, I discovered Kate Davies' really, really awesome <a href="http://needled.wordpress.com/designs/" target="_top">o w l s sweater</a> - and how can you help falling in love with something as beautiful as that? So now I'm constantly browsing the net in search of affordable yarn (being a mean college student, Rowan unfortunately doesn't count as affordable *cry*). As for now, I've set my mind on Istex Alafoss Lopi, but I won't need the sweater before October or so, so I really hope I can purchase the yarn some time during summer. That being said, I have to reveal that the o w l s sweater wasn't the stupid thing I mentioned. The stupid thing was starting a new pair of socks. <a href="http://www.knitty.com/ISSUEsummer07/PATTcoupling.html" target="_top">Coupling socks</a>, to be precise. I'm teaching a friend of mine how to knit socks toe-up and how to knit two socks at one time using two circulars. But to be able to teach, I'll have to be able to knit along with her and because we've discovered the yarn together, we started knitting socks simultaneously. So I have one more wip *sigh* Oh, and I have a friend's birthday coming up and I promised her I'll knit her a pair of socks for her birthday. I've already set my mind on some yarn and a pattern (improvised, at the most), but I've got less than a month left and I don't know if I can finish them in time with Seascape and learning and stuff. Oh, and blogging. So goodbye for now, I hope next time I can proudly present Mom's Seascape Stole ;)]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Stash raid!!!!</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>Yes</em>, I have just started the Gossamer Garden Stole. I love it, by the way. I made a mistake somewhere between rows 13 and 16, so I thought it best to rip the whole thing apart again and start fresh. Which I did. Now I've made a mistake somewhere between rows 24 and 27 and I'm in no mood to rip it apart again so I'm thinking about fixing it by cheating.
<em>Yes</em>, I tend to start too many projects and finish way too few. I think this is mostly because I bore easily so that I can't bring myself to finish something that is neither coming along very quickly nor complicated as hell. Which is the case with pullovers, cardigans or even vests.
<em>Yes</em>, I have so many other useful things to do, like studying, or finishing some of my WIPs. I could read more (or why do I have the subscription for this news magazine? why do I have so many books?), or clean the flat (at least my room!) every day or two, maybe even finish all these "Oh, that's easy, I could sew it myself!"-projects (a skirt, a broken zipper on a coat, and an ex-pullover soon to be a cardigan).
<em>Yes</em>, I have many, many WIPs that I could finish (see point #2), shrugs, socks, even a pullover, legwarmers, ...
But yet...
Right now, I feel the urgent need to raid my stash for anything yarny (I seriously doubt that's even a word!!), something worsted, or even something bulky, and start cardigans, cardigans, pullovers, cardigans and: cardigans. Maybe one or two shrugs. The need actually is so urgent I can hardly keep to my desk chair. It's not that my stash is insanely huge, it fits quite well into two large boxes, so I guess there's not enough yarn for all these cardigans. But: I want to knit something for the fall and winter seasons. I want to knit cardigans with an intensity that equals little children crying "I. Want. Candy!!!!!" in a supermarket.
Why - oh! why? - did this H&amp;M catalogue had to arrive today? Flipping through the pages and seeing all these gorgeous things in all these gorgeous colours (H&amp;M is obviously going for purple and teal this fall, as well as gray and brown) made me wish that my stash could miraculously transform itself into tons of knitted garments.
So if you would be so kind as to excuse me - I have a stash to raid ;)]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Once again, it's been a while. Since my last post and since I've last picked up my knitting. (My wrist was very thankful for the latter.) I spent four of the last five weeks studying, and after 10 hours of studying, I wasn't even able to utter one sentence that could possibly make any sense to anyone, let alone knitting lace.
But I had my exam on Tuesday, and I passed it - once again, the outcome doesn't appeal to me, but who cares, right? After just being relieved and spending too much money on new clothes, I picked up my knitting on Wednesday. A few rows on my honeycomb (I probably won't be able to wear it until fall, it's coming too slowly) and then I couldn't resist the feel of Alpaca Cloud. So I set on to continue Anna's Print O'The Wave Stole. And it makes me happy :) I thought the pattern a bit complicated at first, but after two or three pattern repeats, I hardly have to check with the chart. Which is risky, because I tend to get bored easily. I don't think that Print O'The Wave will bore me out, though, the pattern is just waaaaaaaaay too beautiful!]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I just started to rip the Print O'The Wave Stole apart, because I finally figured my long tail cast-on would be too unflexible for blocking. All the work for nothing :( And I should have known it better! Well. and since unraveling is such an ungrateful job to do, I kept my head busy with a little bit of calculating and I came up with a timeline for this project - a ridiculous timeline, but a timeline nonetheless:

For the sake of my wrist (and my other WIPs) I should limit myself to one pattern repeat per day. Since the original pattern uses a two-part center panel with 17 pattern repeats each and I want to spare myself the grafting, I'm knitting the center panel in one piece. So that makes 34 pattern repeats or 34 days until I'm done with the center panel. Nearly five weeks. SIGH!! (I truely hope Anna never ever will read this!) Please, please, please don't ask me about what I'm going to do when it comes to the edging, I haven't thought about it yet. (With almost five weeks to go, I don't think I'll have to ;))

And now I'm going to study <a href="http://www.grumperina.com/cables.htm" target="_blank">"Cabling without a cable needle"</a> again, because I never can remember how it's done exactly when I haven't worked on a piece for some time, so I can go on with my Honeycomb vest. I'm not in the mood to wrap my head around methods for Invisible Cast-Ons, the pain is just too fresh...]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I really didn't think that my schedule for Anna's Print O'The Wave Stole would work out - but it does! With one pattern repeat per day, I'm getting along - slowly, but steadily. And with only twelve rows to one pattern repeat for the stole, I have plenty of time for other things. Like my Honeycomb vest. I finished the backpiece yesterday (which I'm rather proud of) and started the frontpiece today.
I also went to my LYS today and bought some new yarn:
<strong>Opal Harry Potter</strong>, so I can start on the Hedwig the Owl socks for my friend anytime.
<strong>Davos</strong>, a fuzzy cotton-acrylic-mix.
<strong>Mohair Fine</strong>, in a beautiful burgundy. I'm planning to make a shawl out of this, but I'm not yet sure which pattern I'll use.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Well, well, well...
I have to confess, my schedule didn't quite work out. It did at first, but when I was down to only 14 or 15 more pattern repeats I started to see the light at the end of the tunnel and brought myself to two pattern repeats. And then I did three, so I had the center panel finished by Saturday. I immediately started with the edging and - oh, boy! - these 640 stitches I had to pick up? They gave me a serious headache, with all the counting and miscounting and recounting and miscounting again... And knitting them all for four rounds? Oh, don't get me started...
I was ready to begin with the actual edging by yesterday and guess what? I've already finished one of the short sides and the corresponding corner. And now I'm thinking about buying a wooden circular needle because I feel the metal circular I'm using is too heavy for the stole. Phew...]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm still working on the edging for the Print O' The Wave Stole. Three sides are done and I've already started to work on the remaining long side but - alas! - I'm getting reeeeeaaaaaally tired by this. It's what happens to me every single time I'm getting close to the finish line with one of my knitting projects. Suddenly every project seems more fun than the one I'm working on, especially projects I haven't even started yet, and I really have to force myself to complete the current project. I honestly didn't expect this to happen to me with the Print O' The Wave Stole, because the pattern is so pretty and I really love the Alpaca Cloud yarn (oh! don't get me started on the really gorgeous colorway! Stream Heather... Love it!!!), but here I am: Getting tired and beginning to look forward to all the other lace projects in my Ravelry queue. (I swore to myself that I'll finish my Honeycomb vest first... we'll see how that goes ;))]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Everything happened just as I feared. I've been knitting along merrily, looking forward to all the projects I could start (Laminaria, finally!, Shipwreck, the Aeolian Shawl, my very own Birch, the Luna Moth Shawl... and that's just the tip of the iceberg of all the lace projects I've planned), but then yardage kicked my butt :( Now, I'm painfully aware of the fact that 880 yards (or 804 meters) are 5 pattern repeats short of finishing the stole. Only 5 pattern repeats! That's like, one and a half hours of knitting! And I'm really kind of a tight knitter! SIGH!!!!
Unfortunately, I have no means to get my hands on another hank of Alpaca Cloud in that color since it is sold out at knittybitty and KnitPicks doesn't ship to Europe. So there's only one thing I can do (and it really, really pains me to write this or - and even more so - accept the fact): I have to rip apart the whole edging, leave out the eyelet and increase rounds (even though they look sooooooo pretty) and start all over again. SIGH!! Luckily I was witty enough to calculate the number of stitches I'm short to finishing (something around 1890, if you need to know ;)) and compare that to the number of stitches I'm gaining by leaving out the 4 knitted rounds (a little more than 2560), so that I know (quite for a fact, actually) that it will work out and I won't have to rip the edging apart again.
And now I'm going to shed some tears and unravel the edging I was so proud of...]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[It's done!! Finally!! I've spent the past one and a half hours crouching on my bed and putting a gazillion pins into my mattress. (In other words: blocking the Print O' The Wave Stole.) And even though this is the sort of thing I'd normally love (doing stupid things that repeat themselves over and over and wasting a lot of time in the process), I loathe blocking! Because I suck at blocking! I never seem to get it right. This time, it looks quite good, but we'll see if it works out when the stole is dry ;)]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Well, well... After all this fuss with the edging for the Print O' The Wave Stole, merrily knitting along, running out of yarn, the sudden need for instant gratification that made me start the Endpaper Mitts, ripping apart the transition rows and reknitting the edging, I'm anxious about the moment I'll have to part from it. This day is drawing closer and closer, and I'm already mourning the loss. Even though the stole gave me a pretty hard time (I have to say it once again: ripping the close-to-finished edging apart REALLY wasn't fun - even with my general appetite for destruction!!), I think the yarn and especially the colour suit the pattern very well.

I had to start something new just after I put the finishing touches to the stole, of course, so I went for something that we here in Germany call bolero. Even though I'm not quite sure if I'm knitting a bolero or a shrug, it's got something of both ;) I had to rip my Honeycomb apart because I needed the yarn, which might sound bewildering at first. The thing is this: Some weeks ago I purchased a really gorgeous summer dress - I would go as far as calling it THE dress - which is white with a bottle-green flower pattern. But summer nights are cold so I'm going to need something to keep me warm. I thought about possibilities (possibilities I would knit myself, of course!), but in my mind all these possibilities had the same hue of green as the pattern on the dress. It was then that I thought about my Honeycomb, about how it had this exact hue I'd need to fit the colour of the dress, about being anxious that the pattern would fit me in the end, and about having so much yarn to choose from if I could only bring myself to rip it apart and start fresh. So Honeycomb became history and I started my bolero.

Yesterday evening, I finished the second sleeve and instantly washed and blocked both sleeves as well as the back piece. Once the pieces are dry I'll sew them together so I can determine the size and shape of the front pieces. Once these are finished I'm going to add borders to sleeves and body in 1x1 rib. And then I'll set off and knit a pair of mittens to fit the bolero (just in case it gets reeeaaaaally cold while I'm outside ;)).

Well, since I have to wait for the bolero pieces to dry (and since the Bird's Eye pattern I'm using for the bolero isn't exactly what I'd call excruciatingly difficult) I set my mind on another lace project. I had started a Laminaria after finishing the Print O' The Wave Stole, but tossed it aside after 40 stitches or so and started the bolero, so this won't be an option for some time. Looking for inspirations I browsed through all the bookmarked lace stoles and shawls on my computer and... found the <a href="http://www.popknits.com/index.php/patterns/page/gossamer_garden_stole/" target="_blank">Gossamer Garden Stole</a>. I checked my yarn stash - and there it was, 4 balls of Mohair Fine (76% kid mohair, 24% polyamide) in a dark blue hue I had bought and set aside for "some lace project". As it turns out, the yarn has a beautiful purple shimmer to it, even though I'm not happy with the quality. It's my own fault, really, for I am constantly comparing it to Rowan's KSH - which is ridiculous, since Mohair Fine costs about one fifth of what I'd have to spend for KSH! I'm just trying to concentrate on the purple shimmer and the really gorgeous pattern instead of the yarn quality. And - oh, boy! - this pattern's got teeth. It's not that it is so difficult, but it's all counting and concentrating on what I'm doing (basically: doing what I love most about lace!). I had some difficulties with the chart, but I think I figured it out allright the first time. I haven't knit lace with YOs in right and wrong side rows before, but at least I'm a chart knitter and so far it seems that I've done everything right. Oh, I can't wait until I've finished the first pattern repeat of the Spider Web Pattern :D]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I haven't been knitting much over the last couple of days. Nothing, to be precise. And I shouldn't even be blogging right now. Why? Because I have an exam on - <i>eeeeeeeeek!!</i> - Monday. With every passing minute I'm getting more and more panicky - chances are I won't be able to remember my own name on Monday morning *sigh*
I finished Mom's Seascape Stole somewhere along the way (I usually don't get panicky and studyish - if that's a real word - until 48 hours before the exam, so the fact that I spent last week entirely in my university's library is quite an achievement for me ;)) but I couldn't bring myself to blocking it yet. We'll see when that happens.
Plus knitting is quite out of the question with my wrist hurting as hell (writing dozens of small help-me-to-remember-the-important-facts cards wasn't really helping my RSI), so I'll have to wait while the brilliant ideas keep fighting the urge for knitting for the place on top of my queue. My "What I'd wish for the most right now" queue, that is.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Well, my exam is over. I passed it. Though I'm having a bit of a hard time to be satisfied with what I achieved. But never mind...
Since I'm not able to knit riight now (the ungrateful wrist) I brought myself to finally continue crocheting my carpet. Yes, a carpet.. Yes, crochet. Two or three years ago, my Mom came home from work with a garbage bag (one of these huge ones) full of garnet yarn for me. I don't think there is a color I don't have a little ball of garnet yarn for. To be honest: With some colors I wasn't even sure if someone could wear that color as a garment... I looked at her blankly and asked her what I was to do with these tons of garnet yarn. And she suggested crocheting a carpet. So I went off to buy the biggest crochet hook available in the nearest LYS. I got a 7mm one which is quite an achievement if you knew the size of my home town (and the LYS ;)) and started crocheting. I don't like it very much, it's too simple and there are so many stitches that it takes an eternity to finish only one row - but if I'll ever be able to finish it, I will have a one-of-a-kind carpet! ;)]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Well, I'm still procrastinating. I didn't make it to the library today (again...), since I woke up around 10 a.m. and by then the library normally is crowded. So I stayed at home and guess what - at first I did study quite effectively. But then I thought 'Why not unravel some of these very nasty skeins you've got?' and startet to unravel and reravel (is that even a word??) some skeins from Mommy's old yarn stash I've inherited when she gave up knitting years ago. Takes approximately half an hour per yarn and is definitely more fun than studying... *hmpf!!!*]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[It's done. I finished a WIP. I have to repeat it, slowly, so that I can understand the full extent of its meaning: I finished a WIP. If you knew me, you would give me standing ovations, I'm telling you ;)
I spent Thursday evening knitting the 1x1 ribbing around the body of the Bird's Eye Bolero, which took some time. And after that I spent half the night binding off what felt like hundreds of stitches using the tubular bind-off for the first time. And I'm really surprised how stretchy it is, exactly what I needed for the ribbings. Friday morning was for completing the ribbings on the sleeves and now I'll just have to knit the mittens to go with the shrug.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Over the last two days, I've been thinking "Oh, I shouldn't have done that" constantly. This thought is not referring to my stash raid, by the way (I postponed that), but to the fact that I gave the Owls Sweater a try. I have this gorgeous merino yarn, and I meant to start a pullover or cardigan or any other other garment that might keep me warm once winter has come with it anyway. (And it's really not that hard to knit winter garments right now, considering the temperature we have to endure here in Germany for the past few days.) I really don't know how long I can keep to it, and if it'll come out allright, because I had to recalculate almost everything due to gauge. We'll see about that *sigh*]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I had to rip it apart... again :( The Gossamer Garden Stole. At some point I always happen to miraculously loose a stitch. It just vanishes and I'm left with discovering "Oh, the pattern says 'Knit 6 stitches' but if I do, the YO is in the wrong place". I've cursed a lot the last few days ;) And then, yesterday, when I finally realized that I won't be able to fix it by cheating, and went to unraveling the stole, I gave the yarn such a firm tug that I accidentally ripped it :/
Maybe I should turn to work on my Mum's cardigan while I'm at my parents', because I always leave it here when I'm returning to Study City ;)]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Even though I'm still heavily in love with the Gossamer Garden Stole, and even though my Owls sweater is far from being finished (and I'm really, really planning on finishing both before starting anything else), oh, and then there are the Hedwig the Owl Socks, I'm already thinking about what I can do next.
Once Conny has returned from the US, I'll be able to add three lovely yarns to my stash (Trendsetter Cashwool, Conjoined Creations Pastimes, Too and Cascade Yarns Alpaca Lace) that will be worked into different shawls and wraps and stoles.
And then along came Mam. She was so kind as to gift me two gorgeous pairs of shoes (black pumps, to be precise), and when I asked her how I could possibly return the favour she said: "Well, if you feel the urge to knit something for somebody else some day, you could do a shawl for me..." Well, we sat down right that afternoon and decided on a pattern (the North Roe Shawl) as well as yarn (KnitPicks Shimmer in Spice), so now I just have to finish my projects, order the yarn and I'm ready to go. Damn, I love lace knitting! :D]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA["I'm not knitting."
Isn't that such a terrible thing to state? And yet... Well... It's true: I'm not knitting. I ran out of Mohair Fine on Monday, because I only packed one ball of it. I never ever - not even in my wildest dreams! - thought that I'd use it all up while I'm at my parents', mostly because I thought the pattern for the Gossamer Garden Stole quite challenging to follow and I couldn't imagine myself sticking to that project and, well, actually falling in love with it.
So, what am I to do? I could knit Mom's cardigan, for sure, but I fear we'll soon run into a sizing problem. I had finished that cardigan about two years ago and after two or three months, Mom asked me if I could re-knit it, since its fit was too loose. I didn't object, frogged the whole thing and started over, this time according to the measurements of one of her favourite sweaters. This was about half a year ago. She has been losing weight constantly since then and I seriously doubt that the cardigan will fit her this time. And I don't want to finish something first, then have to frog it again.
Plus: I really, REALLY should be studying. I have my book and my notes lying right here on my desk, next to my keyboard, but I can't bring myself to study for more than an hour - even though there isn't much that I could do instead.
I'd rather think about how I'm going to spend today's afternoon. Anna and I talked about a trip to the city last evening, apparently there's a sale at a yarn store (which made my eyes go all wide and watery), plus she told me about another yarn store where you can get KSH for 7€ a ball (which made me almost cry for joy). So we decided to take the trip, get a cup of coffee somewhere and drop by these yarn stores. And then there's another thing that comes to mind: Wolle Rödel, the LYS chain where I bought the Mohair Fine, has a store in the city, too... Maybe I should pay them a visit and look for a ball of Mohair Fine. I'll need another one anyway...]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm really in a kind of knitting frenzy right now. I've almost finished half of the body part for the Owls sweater and I was pleasantly surprised to see that I was completely right about the motivation originating from its process. Sounds a bit weird, doesn't it? Well, the thing is: I bore easily. And I think I've mentioned that fact a few times. That's because it's oh! so true. I bore easily. So you can imagine that there's almost nothing I loathe as much as knitting a sweater in stockinette stitch. Except for blocking, probably. And here I am, knitting a sweater in stockinette stitch, in a solid colored yarn (black, of all colors!), on 4mm needles! Do you have any idea how very proud I am that I've almost finished half of the body part? Well, I think now you can guess... And that thing about motivation originating from process? That's quite simple: I've reached the part with the back increases by now, and that means that I can count. I can say to myself "10 decreases to go" or "2 rows until the next decrease" and so I work myself through the whole body, always counting and trying to motivate myself.
If only I shouldn't rather be studying!!]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Once again, I'm a part-time non-knitter. Not because I finally realized that studying and taking the next exam is more important than constant progress of my WIPs. I'd love to be as reasonable as that! It's just that my RSI kicked back in which makes knitting a quite painful experience. So I had to put a stop to all of my projects for two weeks, and I really, really hope that I can pick up the needles after that.

Despite the fact that knitting is out of the question right now, I set my mind on another project: Another Seascape Stole, this one a Christmas gift, made from KnitPicks Shimmer in the Cumulus colourway, for a friend of mine. She's always so kind and supportive and I don't know what I would do without her, so I'm thinking this might be the best way to say "Thank you!". The yarn has already been ordered (along with the yarn for Mam's shawl) and should arrive by the end of this week.

What makes this knitting hiatus even harder for me is the fact that I finally got the yarn from Balitmore:
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" title="Cascade Yarns Alpaca Lace" src="http://i800.photobucket.com/albums/yy283/schnecksche/Yarns/dscf0008-1.jpg?t=1249979209" alt="" width="295" height="221" /></p>

Two skeins Cascade Yarns Alpaca Lace in Amethyst Heather. This one's gorgeous, super-soft and quite irresistable.
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" title="Conjoined Creations Pastimes, Too" src="http://i800.photobucket.com/albums/yy283/schnecksche/Yarns/dscf0007-1.jpg?t=1249979209" alt="" width="295" height="221" /></p>

One skein Conjoined Creations Pastimes, Too in Sky. I've already wound it to a ball and practiced the lace cast-on with this one. And now I know that I'll definitely use wooden needles because it is so slippery on the metal ones.
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" title="Criative Acres Black Suri" src="http://i800.photobucket.com/albums/yy283/schnecksche/Yarns/dscf0009-1.jpg?t=1249979504" alt="" width="295" height="221" /></p>

And last but not least, one skein of Criative Acres Black Suri. This one's actually got the names of the alpacas printed on the label that donated the fibres for the yarn - how cool is that?

And then, just this morning, I've made one of the greatest discoveries: I found a German yarn store with an online shop that offers a wide range of yarns from US brands like Cascade Yarns, Fleece Artist or Crystal Palace!! I was amazed. And very, very happy. This is like shopping paradise for me. But maybe I'm just obsessed... ;)]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Wanted: Possible knitting luggage</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm leaving Ulm again for my parents' tomorrow. I'm going to do house-sitting together with my brother while Mam and Dad are enjoying their well-deserved holiday in Spain. I'm travelling by train and I think I'll take my laundry with me (3 sets of bedclothes and clothes for 2 weeks, among other things), so any extra luggage has to be light and compact. Of course, I'll have to take some of my knitting projects with me (screw the RSI!). The problem is: I can't decide neither on the number of projects, nor on which projects I should choose. So I'm trying to lay down some rules:
1) The Owls sweater isn't an option, because the yarn is spun on a cone which isn't really fit for travel.
2) I shouldn't start another "big" project before I haven't finished the Owls sweater, so cardigans and/or sweaters are out of the question.
3) I shouldn't start medium projects like shawls and stoles either, even though I'd very much like to cast on for Mam's North Roe Shawl or Conny's Seascape Stole (the yarn arrived on Friday).
4) I shouldn't take many different projects with me. Instead I should try to concentrate on a small number of projects and maybe even finish one of them.
If I try to stick to these rules, the number of projects reduces dramatically:
<ul>
	<li>The Gossamer Garden Stole (WIP @35%)</li>
	<li> Coupling Socks (WIP @15%)</li>
	<li>Cabled Legwarmers (WIP @50%)</li>
	<li>Spiral Lace Beret (WIP @65%)</li>
	<li>Circular Shrug</li>
	<li>Hedwig The Owl Socks</li>
	<li>Fuzzy Grace Lace Beret</li>
</ul>
I really don't know what to do :(]]></content:encoded>

  <title>September Rust</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[(Yeah, well, it really should be October Rust by now, but that would ruin the pun intended, now wouldn't it?)

I've really cut back on blogging recently - half of the time I wasn't even knitting, and when I was knitting I had little time for everything else. (I'm really something like a yarn addict. I can't resist the feel of yarn in my fingers, let alone that of knitted fabric.)

So, what's there to blog about? I've finished the North Roe Shawl in a little less than three weeks, using KnitPicks Shimmer in this beautiful colourway called Spice, which inspired me to headline this post "September Rust" in the first place. The colouring reminds me of fall foliage, all these beautiful autumnal colours, reddish, and brownish, and yellowish, they really look like fallen leaves to me. And since the weather here in Germany has been quite autumnal (somehow we've skipped gossamer here and went from summer straight to fall), I've felt the yearning to listen to Type O Negative's "October Rust" for days in a row, so everything quite came together. I'm really pleased how the shawl turned out.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I realize that I haven't been blogging in, like, months, but little has been going on here - so what should I have been blogging about?
Ever since I knitted the Grace Lace Beret I kind of developed a thing for hats. Slouchy berets look surprisingly good on me, so now I'm knitting hats whenever I feel the urge to. Plus they're like 24h projects, so I can challenge them whenever I don't want to knit anything else. Also, many of my friends came and asked if I could knit a hat for them, so things have been pretty hat-ty around here ;)
And pretty stressful, I can tell you. There've been a lot of parties, and girls night outs, and game nights, and between studying the whole day and kind of partying all night, there's not much room left for knitting. (Of course I'm a little exaggerating on the studying-all-day-partying-all-night-thing, but it comes pretty close to the truth and it *really* wears me out ;))
So what's the status? I'm putting the finishing touches to Conny's Seascape Stole where I'm halfway through Chart C. (It's about time, since it still has to be a Christmas gift!) The Owls Sweater is at something like 80% or so, I'll just have to finish the second sleeve and then I'll be able to knit the owls - finally!! :D then there's the Snowboard Hat I'm knitting for a friend of mine, plus all the other WIPs I don't even dare to think about ;) I think I'll just return to the Seascape Stole now - I intend to have it finished by the end of the day.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Lace Christmas</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Since we weren't going to have a white Christmas this year (again!) I decided to make it a lace Christmas.

Well... Actually... No. This lace Christmas thing kind of evolved on its own: After I decided to knit the Seascape Stole for Conny, two things happened. Firstly, I vowed to myself to never, ever knit the same lace pattern twice again. It really bores me out of my mind! Secondly, I felt the urge to knit something intricate and lacy just for myself. We'll have to see about the never-ever-knit-a-pattern-twice rule, but as for the intricate and lacy part, I didn't come very far. The Swallowtail Lace Shawl (knit in Cascade Yarns Alpaca Lace, Amethyst Heather) and the Laminaria Shawl (knit in KnitPicks Shimmer, Sherry) both are undoubtedly lacy - but I wouldn't consider them to be especially intricate. Lovely, of course, fun, sure, but not intricate.
So I'm very much hoping to find a lace project that's going to make me want to rip my hair out - or my knitting apart, for that matter - in one of my Christmas gifts: Victorian Lace Today, Knitted Lace of Estonia and A Gathering of Lace. My parents gifted me all three of them as paperbacks (I suppose my "Give me lace books for Christmas and you'll have loads of patterns to choose your next shawl from" remark to my mother had something to do with it ;)), so I'll have only one problem after I've finished the Laminaria (which might happen today): What am I going to knit next?]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[So there it was: My perfect evening. After three days of criminally neglecting the fact that I ought to learn for my upcoming exam (meaning: three days of constant knitting, because Marika kept bugging me about finishing the owls sweater so that I could wear it at least once before this winter season ends) I was finally casting off stitches.
I really tried to sew in the ends carefully, despite the growing excitement.
I could hardly bear the tension.
I tried it on.
...
And then I just wanted to cry. It didn't fit me. In fact, it felt like someone had tied a string around my upper chest and pulled really tightly. Well, of course I instantly realised what was wrong with my most beloved, most time consuming (and therefore most hated) WIP to date: I had miscalculated the number of owls. Disappointed with myself and the knitting gods, I laid the sweater aside and tried not to think about this failure. Because the saddest part of it all was that everything else about this sweater was perfect. The back width, the chest, the sleeve length, the look, everything. I was determined to MAKE it fit me, even if I had to block it to death.
I soon realized that there was only one possibility, but I wasn't ready to consider it, so I almost instantly cast on another sweater (let's call it the Rebound Sweater). After only seven rows of knitting I came to my senses and laid it aside again. I shed a tear or two and started to undo the sewing on the owls sweater. Then I frogged the yoke until I was back to the 377 (in words: three hundred and seventy-seven) stitches on the 4mm needles. I started to calculate, and recalculate, and recalculate again, until I finally found a way to add more owls.
For the first version I did k2tog around, which left me with 19 owls. This time I repeated [k1, k2tog, k2tog] around, with an additional knit stitch every ten repeats or so. It took a long time, because at the same time I had to keep track of the [k2, p8] pattern from the cable chart (tricky!!), but I had it done by midnight.
I think it'll take more time to finish the owls sweater now, because my exam is coming up and I can't spend the days until the big day knitting, but at least I'll have a fitting sweater when I'm done. SIGH!]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Stripy Serrano</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Even though I vowed to behave, I couldn't resist finishing the Owls sweater before my exam. And it's perfect now. I think it's going to be one of my favourite sweaters of all times. It flatters my shape in all the right ways, the yarn is supersoft and the changes I made to the neckline (I stuck to the concept of the short rows, but I used them to shape the neckline at the front) come out just great.

Being me, I couldn't just pick out one of my already-on-the-needles-projects and finish that. No, I had to start something new and shiny. (I'm really like a little child in that way, always going for the new toys instead of cherishing the old ones...) So I cast on for my Serrano cardigan.
Serrano is a great choice for me, because my Mam's stash (which I inherited once she stopped knitting) contains 10+ skeins of sock yarn, even though she has never been a sock knitter. I'm not a passionate sock knitter, either. In fact, if I didn't know how to knit two socks at the same time, I'd never finish a pair of them! Unfortunately, the colours of her sock yarn skeins aren't of that irresistible kind that seems to scream "Knit me!" (Like the one skein I just HAD to buy on Thursday - it's teal, so I think everyone understands why I couldn't resist...) Her sock yarn was to end up in pairs of socks that keep your feet warm but should never be seen in daylight, like muddy browns and greys. I couldn't picture myself wearing one of these. But a careful selection proved to be the ideal choice for a slightly modified version of Serrano, a striped one. So I have four colours, an off-white, a camel-heather, a slightly brownish light grey, and a very curious shade of brown with a hint of grey and some kind of lavender. It sounds very suspicious, I admit that, but they go great together!
As for the pattern itself, I have to say that I'm completely surprised how quick it knits up! I did a few rows while still learning for my exam, so I couldn't kickstart the project until Thursday evening, but nevertheless I'm already halfway through the waist increases! The lace pattern is easy to memorize and looks beautiful, plus its zig-zaggy notion complements the yarn very well, I change colours every 12 rows and it works great with the different directions of the YOs.
I guess it won't take me long to finish this one :)]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Oh lord, do I hate my hobby right now! When you are a knitter with friends who cherish handmade items for presents or even ask you right away to knit something for them, it's hard to say no. At least for me it is.
So here I am, stuck with a pair of socks (did I mention that I hate to knit socks! I do! I do, I do, I absolutely do!!!) and a snowboard-hat-to-be. And several pairs of socks in my Ravelry queue. I don't know how that happened, but I know that I will cast on every single pair and realize at some point along the way that I very probably won't finish them. Except of course the pair I'm working on right now, because I promised almost a year ago to have it finished in about a month from now. As for the snowboard-hat-to-be, I have only about two weeks left... :(
Luckily it's so freaking cold that I don't have to think of transition garments yet (at least in terms of knitting - shopping sprees however are subject to a very different logic ;)), so it's no tragedy that I won't be able to finish my Serrano cardigan until the end of the March.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[What should I be doing?
Studying. Long hours of studying for my upcoming exam. Which is in 11 days. And I still can't guarantee I won't get a nervous breakdown sometime around a week from now.

What am I doing?
Knitting, obviously. After frogging my Abby cowl for the second time (I didn't like the lace pattern), I was contemplating whether to start the Copycat Lydia Cardigan or a pair of socks with this beautiful sock yarn I bought. Well... I chose the socks. We'll see how that'll turn out...]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[My desk is nearly breaking down from the weight of papers on Light Source Measurement, Global Illumination and the like, as well as notes on everything concerning Visual Effects and Simulation Algorithms. Sounds like Chinese? Yeah, well, the latter two (Visual Effects and Simulation Algorithms) are the titles of the two lectures I'm currently trying to stuff into my brain.

Having a knitting project accompany my studying has always worked for me, so even though it is summer I decided to start a new Yes-I-know-I-should-be-studying knitting project. Temperatures dropped like 10°C over night anyway, and this breezy 20 something degrees Celsius outside seem like perfect knitting weather anyway.
A German TV station with a strong focus on programs of cultural interest (they even call themselves "der Kultursender" which roughly translates to "the culture channel") has recently featured many films and specials on Jane Austen. Not only the almost legendary and gorgeous BBC version of "Pride and Prejudice" but also the fun and witty "Lost in Austen" adaption. So practically, I have no other choice but deciding on a project from my copy of "Jane Austen Knits". Which, in this case, is the Pemberley Slippers. So I'm going to lift my heavy yarn boxes down from my dresser to go look fo some sport weight yarn. Light Source Measurement is getting old anyway. Oh, and overrated, too.]]></content:encoded>
