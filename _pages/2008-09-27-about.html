<p><strong>Stricksucht</strong>, <em>f.</em> German term for knitting addiction</p>
<p>Just in case that you have been wondering why my English sounds so strange sometimes... I'm German, so I'm not what you would call a native speaker. But I'm trying, though. Please be so kind to let me know when I make major mistakes - I love to learn ;)</p>
<p><strong>So what is this about?</strong><br />
I want this blog to be about knitting, about my current projects and their process, about techniques I learned here and there (mostly on the internet), about my ideas for knitwear, and so on.</p>
<p><strong>So what am I about?</strong><br />
My mother taught me the basics of knitting (how to cast on, knit, purl, and bind off) when I was 9 or 10 years old, but I was more interested in crocheting back then. At the age of 15, however, I became interested in knitting, and after my mother gave me her box of leftover yarns and a book covering the basics of handcrafting, I was ready for my very first scarf. It was just a plain, light blue scarf in simple 1x1 rib, but I'm still wearing it every year from fall to the first signs of spring.</p>
<p>My knitting addiction didn't become serious until 2 or 3 years ago, when I discovered the fabulous knitty.com. I learned the English names for stitches and - more importantly - I learned that knitting is more than the slightly boring and non-challenging patterns I knew from German knitting magazines. And since then, I spend my spare time knitting, beginning even more knitting projects or convincing my friends to join me in my knitting frenzy.</p>
