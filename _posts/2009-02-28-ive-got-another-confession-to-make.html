<p>Yeah, well, I didn't do it. I didn't finish Mom's Seascape Stole. Partly because I actually spent the last couple of days learning (10 hours in the library, followed by whatever I could bring myself to back at home), and partly because my RSI kicked in again. So Seascape will have to wait until my wrist gets better *sigh*<br />
But I've got another project coming up: After reading <a href="http://knitty.com/ISSUEwinter07/FEATwin07FK.html" target="_top">this knitty article</a> and <a href="http://eunnyjang.com/knit/2006/01/steeking_chronicles_the_should.html" target="_top">Eunny Jang's Steeking Chronicles</a> (especially <a href="http://www.eunnyjang.com/knit/2006/01/the_steeking_chronicles_part_i.html" target="_top">the part on the crocheted steek</a>), I remembered a very old sweater of mine I bought at a H&amp;M store about 8 years ago. It never fitted me very well so I can't even remember wearing it. It's got kind of a turtleneck and raglan sleeves, so any large-busted woman in her right mind would have kept her hands off such a sweater. So here's my thought: Why not find out if the thing looks better when worn as a cardigan? It can't be worse than it is now, right? So once I'll get back to Ulm I think I'll instantly take this thing out of my closet, cut it apart in the middle and sew in a zipper. And of course, I'll document the process ;)</p>
