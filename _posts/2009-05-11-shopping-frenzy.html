<p>I really didn't think that my schedule for Anna's Print O'The Wave Stole would work out - but it does! With one pattern repeat per day, I'm getting along - slowly, but steadily. And with only twelve rows to one pattern repeat for the stole, I have plenty of time for other things. Like my Honeycomb vest. I finished the backpiece yesterday (which I'm rather proud of) and started the frontpiece today.<br />
I also went to my LYS today and bought some new yarn:<br />
<strong>Opal Harry Potter</strong>, so I can start on the Hedwig the Owl socks for my friend anytime.<br />
<strong>Davos</strong>, a fuzzy cotton-acrylic-mix.<br />
<strong>Mohair Fine</strong>, in a beautiful burgundy. I'm planning to make a shawl out of this, but I'm not yet sure which pattern I'll use.</p>
