<p>Everything happened just as I feared. I've been knitting along merrily, looking forward to all the projects I could start (Laminaria, finally!, Shipwreck, the Aeolian Shawl, my very own Birch, the Luna Moth Shawl... and that's just the tip of the iceberg of all the lace projects I've planned), but then yardage kicked my butt :( Now, I'm painfully aware of the fact that 880 yards (or 804 meters) are 5 pattern repeats short of finishing the stole. Only 5 pattern repeats! That's like, one and a half hours of knitting! And I'm really kind of a tight knitter! SIGH!!!!<br />
Unfortunately, I have no means to get my hands on another hank of Alpaca Cloud in that color since it is sold out at knittybitty and KnitPicks doesn't ship to Europe. So there's only one thing I can do (and it really, really pains me to write this or - and even more so - accept the fact): I have to rip apart the whole edging, leave out the eyelet and increase rounds (even though they look sooooooo pretty) and start all over again. SIGH!! Luckily I was witty enough to calculate the number of stitches I'm short to finishing (something around 1890, if you need to know ;)) and compare that to the number of stitches I'm gaining by leaving out the 4 knitted rounds (a little more than 2560), so that I know (quite for a fact, actually) that it will work out and I won't have to rip the edging apart again.<br />
And now I'm going to shed some tears and unravel the edging I was so proud of...</p>
