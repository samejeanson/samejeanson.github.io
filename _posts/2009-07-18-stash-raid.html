<p><em>Yes</em>, I have just started the Gossamer Garden Stole. I love it, by the way. I made a mistake somewhere between rows 13 and 16, so I thought it best to rip the whole thing apart again and start fresh. Which I did. Now I've made a mistake somewhere between rows 24 and 27 and I'm in no mood to rip it apart again so I'm thinking about fixing it by cheating.<br />
<em>Yes</em>, I tend to start too many projects and finish way too few. I think this is mostly because I bore easily so that I can't bring myself to finish something that is neither coming along very quickly nor complicated as hell. Which is the case with pullovers, cardigans or even vests.<br />
<em>Yes</em>, I have so many other useful things to do, like studying, or finishing some of my WIPs. I could read more (or why do I have the subscription for this news magazine? why do I have so many books?), or clean the flat (at least my room!) every day or two, maybe even finish all these "Oh, that's easy, I could sew it myself!"-projects (a skirt, a broken zipper on a coat, and an ex-pullover soon to be a cardigan).<br />
<em>Yes</em>, I have many, many WIPs that I could finish (see point #2), shrugs, socks, even a pullover, legwarmers, ...<br />
But yet...<br />
Right now, I feel the urgent need to raid my stash for anything yarny (I seriously doubt that's even a word!!), something worsted, or even something bulky, and start cardigans, cardigans, pullovers, cardigans and: cardigans. Maybe one or two shrugs. The need actually is so urgent I can hardly keep to my desk chair. It's not that my stash is insanely huge, it fits quite well into two large boxes, so I guess there's not enough yarn for all these cardigans. But: I want to knit something for the fall and winter seasons. I want to knit cardigans with an intensity that equals little children crying "I. Want. Candy!!!!!" in a supermarket.<br />
Why - oh! why? - did this H&amp;M catalogue had to arrive today? Flipping through the pages and seeing all these gorgeous things in all these gorgeous colours (H&amp;M is obviously going for purple and teal this fall, as well as gray and brown) made me wish that my stash could miraculously transform itself into tons of knitted garments.<br />
So if you would be so kind as to excuse me - I have a stash to raid ;)</p>
