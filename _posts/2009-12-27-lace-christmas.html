<p>Since we weren't going to have a white Christmas this year (again!) I decided to make it a lace Christmas.</p>
<p>Well... Actually... No. This lace Christmas thing kind of evolved on its own: After I decided to knit the Seascape Stole for Conny, two things happened. Firstly, I vowed to myself to never, ever knit the same lace pattern twice again. It really bores me out of my mind! Secondly, I felt the urge to knit something intricate and lacy just for myself. We'll have to see about the never-ever-knit-a-pattern-twice rule, but as for the intricate and lacy part, I didn't come very far. The Swallowtail Lace Shawl (knit in Cascade Yarns Alpaca Lace, Amethyst Heather) and the Laminaria Shawl (knit in KnitPicks Shimmer, Sherry) both are undoubtedly lacy - but I wouldn't consider them to be especially intricate. Lovely, of course, fun, sure, but not intricate.<br />
So I'm very much hoping to find a lace project that's going to make me want to rip my hair out - or my knitting apart, for that matter - in one of my Christmas gifts: Victorian Lace Today, Knitted Lace of Estonia and A Gathering of Lace. My parents gifted me all three of them as paperbacks (I suppose my "Give me lace books for Christmas and you'll have loads of patterns to choose your next shawl from" remark to my mother had something to do with it ;)), so I'll have only one problem after I've finished the Laminaria (which might happen today): What am I going to knit next?</p>
