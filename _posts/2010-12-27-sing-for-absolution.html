<p>What should I be doing?<br />
Studying. Long hours of studying for my upcoming exam. Which is in 11 days. And I still can't guarantee I won't get a nervous breakdown sometime around a week from now.</p>
<p>What am I doing?<br />
Knitting, obviously. After frogging my Abby cowl for the second time (I didn't like the lace pattern), I was contemplating whether to start the Copycat Lydia Cardigan or a pair of socks with this beautiful sock yarn I bought. Well... I chose the socks. We'll see how that'll turn out...</p>
