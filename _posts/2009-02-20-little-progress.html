<p>So it took me 2 days to finish the 6th pattern repeat on Mum's Seascape Stole. Even though I didn't study much today, somehow this day was totally wasted. I'll have to make up for the time I lost today so I'm planning on spending tomorrow entirely in my university's library, far away from knitting, household tasks or my yarn stash (which I tried to organize today but gave up after photographing some skeins for my Ravelry stash...). Maybe I'll finish going through the slides tomorrow - it would be progress that justifies an evening spent with knitting. Or I'll go out and have a beer with some friends.<br />
'Finish the slides first', says the mean voice in my head. Yes, sir!!</p>
