<p>I tried. I really did. But after reraveling this gorgeous yarn from Mommy's stash I just HAD to see how it would work out in a pattern. Sarah Castor's <a href="http://knitty.com/ISSUEspring08/PATThoneycomb.html" target="_top">Honeycomb vest</a> seemed like the perfect fit for the yarn's color and quality, and because I wanted (really, really badly) to knit it since I first laid my eyes on it I couldn't resist. And well, here's the result:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="Honeycomb" src="assets/3297412002_665e966014.jpg?v=0" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></p>
