<p>(Yeah, well, it really should be October Rust by now, but that would ruin the pun intended, now wouldn't it?)</p>
<p>I've really cut back on blogging recently - half of the time I wasn't even knitting, and when I was knitting I had little time for everything else. (I'm really something like a yarn addict. I can't resist the feel of yarn in my fingers, let alone that of knitted fabric.)</p>
<p>So, what's there to blog about? I've finished the North Roe Shawl in a little less than three weeks, using KnitPicks Shimmer in this beautiful colourway called Spice, which inspired me to headline this post "September Rust" in the first place. The colouring reminds me of fall foliage, all these beautiful autumnal colours, reddish, and brownish, and yellowish, they really look like fallen leaves to me. And since the weather here in Germany has been quite autumnal (somehow we've skipped gossamer here and went from summer straight to fall), I've felt the yearning to listen to Type O Negative's "October Rust" for days in a row, so everything quite came together. I'm really pleased how the shawl turned out.</p>
