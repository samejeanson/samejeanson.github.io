<p>Even though I vowed to behave, I couldn't resist finishing the Owls sweater before my exam. And it's perfect now. I think it's going to be one of my favourite sweaters of all times. It flatters my shape in all the right ways, the yarn is supersoft and the changes I made to the neckline (I stuck to the concept of the short rows, but I used them to shape the neckline at the front) come out just great.</p>
<p>Being me, I couldn't just pick out one of my already-on-the-needles-projects and finish that. No, I had to start something new and shiny. (I'm really like a little child in that way, always going for the new toys instead of cherishing the old ones...) So I cast on for my Serrano cardigan.<br />
Serrano is a great choice for me, because my Mam's stash (which I inherited once she stopped knitting) contains 10+ skeins of sock yarn, even though she has never been a sock knitter. I'm not a passionate sock knitter, either. In fact, if I didn't know how to knit two socks at the same time, I'd never finish a pair of them! Unfortunately, the colours of her sock yarn skeins aren't of that irresistible kind that seems to scream "Knit me!" (Like the one skein I just HAD to buy on Thursday - it's teal, so I think everyone understands why I couldn't resist...) Her sock yarn was to end up in pairs of socks that keep your feet warm but should never be seen in daylight, like muddy browns and greys. I couldn't picture myself wearing one of these. But a careful selection proved to be the ideal choice for a slightly modified version of Serrano, a striped one. So I have four colours, an off-white, a camel-heather, a slightly brownish light grey, and a very curious shade of brown with a hint of grey and some kind of lavender. It sounds very suspicious, I admit that, but they go great together!<br />
As for the pattern itself, I have to say that I'm completely surprised how quick it knits up! I did a few rows while still learning for my exam, so I couldn't kickstart the project until Thursday evening, but nevertheless I'm already halfway through the waist increases! The lace pattern is easy to memorize and looks beautiful, plus its zig-zaggy notion complements the yarn very well, I change colours every 12 rows and it works great with the different directions of the YOs.<br />
I guess it won't take me long to finish this one :)</p>
