<p>Oh lord, do I hate my hobby right now! When you are a knitter with friends who cherish handmade items for presents or even ask you right away to knit something for them, it's hard to say no. At least for me it is.<br />
So here I am, stuck with a pair of socks (did I mention that I hate to knit socks! I do! I do, I do, I absolutely do!!!) and a snowboard-hat-to-be. And several pairs of socks in my Ravelry queue. I don't know how that happened, but I know that I will cast on every single pair and realize at some point along the way that I very probably won't finish them. Except of course the pair I'm working on right now, because I promised almost a year ago to have it finished in about a month from now. As for the snowboard-hat-to-be, I have only about two weeks left... :(<br />
Luckily it's so freaking cold that I don't have to think of transition garments yet (at least in terms of knitting - shopping sprees however are subject to a very different logic ;)), so it's no tragedy that I won't be able to finish my Serrano cardigan until the end of the March.</p>
