<p>In the <a href="http://www.knitty.com/ISSUEsummer08/PATTseascape.html" target="_blank">original Seascape pattern</a> there's a note that some people felt the stole would be better-sized when adding a 7th repeat of the main pattern. I'm already in the midst of the 7th repeat but I still feel that the stole might come out waaaaaaay too short, so I'm thinking about adding another repeat of the pattern. Well, yeah, I don't even know if the 3 skeins of KSH will suffice for 8 pattern repeats, so IF they do then there won't be any leftovers for me. But on the other hand, I'm knitting this stole for Mum who bought the yarn. Let's just hope that I can make it 8 pattern repeats and the finishing - I can always consider other options if it won't work out.</p>
