<p>Well, I know what I <i>should</i> do... I should by studying. Hard. Almost excessively. I still got 9 days left until the exam on database systems. I need to take this exam and I know it. There's no other way. But I have always preferred the art of procrastination over everything else, so guess what I'm doing? Yepp... procrastinating...<br />
Right now, I'm knitting my ass off for Mom's Seascape Stole. I started the 6th pattern repeat today and I plan on having it finished by the end of the day. I'm nuts.</p>
